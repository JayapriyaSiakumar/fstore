# React + Vite

## fstore — React + Vite

(https://github.com/JayapriyaSiakumar/fstore)

A minimal React app scaffolded with Vite. This README explains how to run, build, and maintain the project and includes GitHub-ready workflows and contribution guidance.

### Features

- Vite dev server with HMR
- React Fast Refresh via official Vite React plugin
- ESLint / Prettier integration (optional)
- Ready for deployment to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- A GitHub repository (recommended) for collaboration and CI

### Quick start

1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/fstore.git
   - cd fstore
2. Install dependencies
   - npm install
   - or yarn
3. Run development server
   - npm run dev
4. Build for production
   - npm run build
5. Preview production build locally
   - npm run preview

Replace JayapriyaSiakumar with your GitHub user or organization.

### Typical scripts (adjust to package.json)

- "dev" — start Vite dev server with HMR
- "build" — build production files into dist/
- "preview" — serve the production build locally
- "lint" — run ESLint
- "format" — run Prettier

Example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

### Environment

- Use .env for local settings
- Vite exposes client vars prefixed with VITE\_ (e.g., VITE_API_URL)
- Restart dev server after changing .env

### Folder structure

- src/
  - main.jsx — app entry
  - App.jsx — root component
  - components/ — reusable UI
  - pages/ — route pages
  - assets/ — images, styles
- public/ — static assets
- dist/ — production output

### GitHub & CI

- Create a repository and push the project
- Recommended GitHub Actions:
  - node CI for install / build / lint
  - deployment workflow for Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages
- Protect main branch and require PR reviews for merges

### Deployment

- Build: npm run build
- Deploy dist/ to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- For GitHub Pages, use an action or set gh-pages to publish dist/

### Contributing

- Fork -> feature branch -> open PR
- Keep PRs small and descriptive
- Run lint and format before opening PR
- Add tests for new features when applicable

### Troubleshooting & tips

- If HMR or env changes don’t apply, restart dev server
- For TypeScript, migrate to the React+TS template and enable type-aware ESLint

### License

Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) at the project root.

If you want, provide package.json and I will update the scripts and badges to match exactly.
